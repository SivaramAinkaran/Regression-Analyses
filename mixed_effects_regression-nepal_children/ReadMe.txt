A Mixed Effects Model for Health of Nepalese Children (conducted in RStudio)

A series of steps to create and analyse a mixed effects model for the health of
nepalese children based on their sex, weight, height, mother's age, mother's 
literacy, the number of children mother has had that died, the number of children
the mother has had born alive and the current age of the child.

The "nepali" data included in the "faraway" package contains 1000 observations from
a public health study on Nepalese children.

(Question 6 includes a simulation using the parametric bootstrap method to test
the joint significance of the fixed effects within this model)
