A Generalised Additive Model for Melbourne Housing (conducted in RStudio)

A series of steps to create and analyse a generalised additive model (GAM)
for the price of Melbourne housing based on the number of rooms in the house, the 
area in square metres, the year it was built and the postcode it is located in.

The included "melb_data.csv" file contains data on 13580 houses, using which, this 
regression has been conducted.
